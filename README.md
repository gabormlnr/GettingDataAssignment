Tidy data and stats

How to run the code:

Run all function definitions that would read and tidy data. These are Features(), Activities(), TestData(), TrainingData(). Then call either getdata(maindir, trainingdir, testdir) to produce the full tidy dataset or getBDstat(maindir, trainingdir, testdir) to produce the mean and the standard deviation of varaiables by activities and subjects. Supplement the main directory, the directory containing traning data and tst data in this order as arguments of the last to functions. These will call the prevoiusly defined functions to read in data from these directories.
